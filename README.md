In this Project we had to create an Instagram profile for the CodeSpace Cats using CSS. The main goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and responsive web page. We had to use features such as Flexbox and Grid to position everything neatly and correctly. At first I was struggling with positioning everything using Flexbox and Float for instance but after some time of doing research and countless attempts I managed to figure it out using additional resources.
